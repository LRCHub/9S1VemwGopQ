Blood on the pedals
Blood on the grips
Steel-leveled, chest-level
Smear my lips
Let them slip into a smile
Because now after awhile
It's all we're seen to do
'Cause the business is as business does
Trash is trash until it's sealed
From above and left on to the corner of your mind to disappear
Lockdown the remains
Machine works best when the machine's not shy
Trash is trash but trash from cash must divide. Body bent, body doubled
Dismissed by time a five to nine
Will serve the nine to five
Lockdown the remains
